# How email and DNS work?

An email has three parts: the envelope, the header and the body. The envelope is the capsule we never see (it is where the email protocol operates in); the header contains the directions (the address where we want to send that email) and the body contains what you actually want to send (text, pictures and other attachments). It is like a snail mail: you write a letter, put this inside an envelope and write the address on that envelope. With this directions (if they are correct), the mail man will be able to deliver this message to the receiver. If there is something wrong with the directions, the letter will be returned to the sender.


DNS stands for domain name server and is the way we figure out how to get to webpages. It is a server dedicated to being a really big lookup table: when we type a webpage address on the browser, it will “ask” the DNS what is the IP address of the server where this page “lives”. The DNS will give this IP number and then our browser will search for this information, taking us to the desired website.
